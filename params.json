{"name":"Gr-gsm","tagline":"Gnuradio blocks and tools for receiving GSM transmissions","body":"The gr-gsm project\r\n==================\r\nThe project is based on the gsm-receiver which was written by me for Airprobe project.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to provide set of tools for receiving information transmitted by GSM equipment/devices.\r\n\r\nInstallation of GNU Radio\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nThe project is based on GNU Radio signal processing framework and takes advantage of its great features like stream tagging and message passing.\r\nInstallation of GNU Radio is therefore a basic requirement for compilation and installation of gr-gsm.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding GNU Radio from source\r\n------------------------------\r\nFor advanced users and developers it is advised to compile GNU Radio and required third party GNU Radio projects from source.\r\n\r\nIn order to compile GNU Radio with optional projects needed in order to receive data from USRP devices (uhd) and RTL-SDR devices (gr-osmosdr) run following commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install git\r\ngit clone git://github.com/pybombs/pybombs\r\ncd pybombs\r\n./pybombs install gnuradio uhd gr-osmosdr\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the first run pybombs will ask for configuration options. As a target directory select /usr/local/. The rest of the options can be left as default.\r\nPybombs will then take care of downloading all of required libraries for installation of gnuradio and it will build and install it in /usr/local/.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation of GNU Radio from packages (Ubuntu 14.10)\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe easier way to install gnuradio is installation from distribution's repository. Currently gr-gsm works with GNU Radio versions 3.7.3 and newer. On Ubuntu 14.10 it is possible to compile and use gr-gsm together with GNU Radio available from distribution's standard repository.\r\nTo do this install all required packages by entering following command in a terminal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install gnuradio-dev gr-osmosdr libgnuradio-uhd3.7.2.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nGr-gsm blocks that will be later installed will be located in /usr/local directory. To tell Gnu Radio Companion to look for blocks in there create config.conf in ~/.gnuradio directory:\r\n```\r\nmkdir ~/.gnuradio\r\ntouch ~/.gnuradio/config.conf\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen edit ~/.gnuradio/config.conf and put following text inside:\r\n```\r\n[grc]\r\nlocal_blocks_path=/usr/local/share/gnuradio/grc/blocks:/usr/share/gnuradio/grc/blocks\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompilation and installation of gr-gsm\r\n======================================\r\n\r\nTo download gr-gsm sources run following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ptrkrysik/gr-gsm.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure that you have all required packages (checked on Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10):\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install cmake libboost-all-dev libcppunit-dev swig \\\r\n                     doxygen liblog4cpp5-dev python-scipy\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo compile and install gr-gsm run:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd gr-gsm\r\nmkdir build\r\ncmake ..\r\nmake\r\nsudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
